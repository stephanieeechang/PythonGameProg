Wrote several programs for practice with if-else statements, for and while loops, also drew corresponding flow charts for each program.
1. Construct pattern with asterisks and for loops
2. Reverse a word of the user’s input
3. Print numbers 0-6, except 3 and 6, using for loops and ‘continue’ statement
4. User enters a non-negative integer number, then the program repeatedly adds all its digits until the result has only one digit.
5. Prints the numbers that are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700.
